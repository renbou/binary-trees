# binary-trees
Qt-based GUI app for presenting how various binary search trees work.  
Currently has AVLtree, Red&Black tree, Treap (tree-heap) as well as Splay tree.  
The trees are made as header-only files, they're from my cpp-lib, ready to use in any projects.  
Qt project uses custom graphicsView which supports mouse dragging as well as mouse zoom-in/zoom-out.
